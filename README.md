# ðŸŽž filt - Image Filtering Library 

**Image Filter extension library for [im](https://github.com/recp/im)**


This will use [Universal Shading Language](http://github.com/UniversalShading) and its **VM** for both CPU and GPU acceleration when US/USL is ready. With USL custom filtering can be written with existing language.

Curently USL is pivate except its spec, but I trying my best to finish its compiler and make it public. 

This library will also be used in [vision](https://github.com/recp/vision), [ai](https://github.com/recp/ai) and maybe in online / offline renderers engines ([gk](https://github.com/recp/gk) / [rays](https://github.com/recp/rays)).

I'll update README by time...
